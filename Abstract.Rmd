### Assessment and evaluation tools for the undergraduate statistics major

This seminar introduces new assessment tools designed to measure learning outcomes of students upon completion of an undergraduate statistics program (e.g. majors) against 96 competencies endorsed by the American Statistical Association.  In short, these assessment tools sought to (1) measure student learning outcomes with respect to program objectives; (2) facilitate year-over-year comparisons to inform continuous improvement of the program/major; (3) search for indications of competencies not explicitly included in the program/major acquired by students through extracurricular experiences.  The seminar will remark on pilot data from Senior/Capstone undergraduate statistics students at several different institutions around the US, early work contrasting these data with faculty expectations as a means for program evaluation, and future goals toward a more complete assessment portfolio.
